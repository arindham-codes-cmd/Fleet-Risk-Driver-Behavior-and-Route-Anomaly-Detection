# Fleet-Risk-Driver-Behavior-and-Route-Anomaly-Detection
We analyse GPS fleet data to evaluate driver behavior, detect risky patterns, and identify route anomalies using real world telematics from California. The goal is to have an end-to-end analytics pipeline that will transform raw trip data into actionable insights for fleet safety, operational efficiency, and proactive risk management.
